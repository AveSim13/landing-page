            <h2>Life is Strange</h2>
            <p>These games fuck me up. For weeks after playing I can't stop thinking of them. I spend my life trying to find my own Rachel Amber to be with &hearts;</p>

            <h2>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</h2>
            <p>This is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and I desperately want sequels. I love Kena to death. So much so I'm planning a Kena tattoo!</p>

            <h2>Master of Orion</h2>
            <p>For literal decades, I have played Master of Orion. I have spent ages trying to find a game as perfect as MoO2. I have yet to do so. I was extremely excited for the new Conquer the Stars game, but they made the same mistakes all newer 4X games make. So I still return to MoO2. It might be as old as I am, but it's a masterpiece.</p>

            <h2>Civilizations</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the closest modern game to MoO, I do enjoy me some Civilization games here and there. It's a cozy game for me. One I can return to time and again to sink some time. I'm a bit of a pacifist and a communist though, so I hope you're prepared to see that play style!</p>

            <h2>DK 64</h2>
            <p>You'll probably see me try to play Donkey Kong 64 here and there. It's another one of those games from my childhood that I've forever tried to find a modern verision of, but to no avail.</p>

            <h2>Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>
            <p>I'll be real with you. CoD isn't my fave. But it's the game a lot of my friends play, and I love playing games with my friends. Someday I hope to have a lil gaming community to play tons of games with. But for now, we'll stick with my IRL friends' games.</p>
